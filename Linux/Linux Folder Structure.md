# ✅ **1. Meaning of:**

**“Your script is in `/root/nginxscript.sh`, and you are in `/home/ubuntu`.”**

This simply means:

* The **file is located inside the root user’s home directory** (`/root`)
* But **your current working directory** is `/home/ubuntu`

### 📌 Example scenario:

When you log in using SSH:

```
ubuntu@ip-xxxx:~$
```

Your home directory is:

```
/home/ubuntu
```

So when I say:

> You are in `/home/ubuntu`
> Your script is in `/root/nginxscript.sh`

It means:

* You (ubuntu user) are currently in `/home/ubuntu`
* The script sits in `/root`, which belongs to the **root user**.

### ❓ So, do you need to become root user?

You have **two options**:

---

## 🟢 **OPTION 1: Stay as ubuntu user & use sudo**

This is the recommended method.

```bash
sudo /root/nginxscript.sh
```

OR:

```bash
sudo bash /root/nginxscript.sh
```

This runs the script with **root privileges** without switching accounts.

---

## 🟢 **OPTION 2: Switch to root user and run it**

```bash
sudo su -
cd /root
./nginxscript.sh
```

Both options work the same.

### ✔ Best practice:

**Use sudo instead of switching to root**
It's safer, cleaner, and logs everything.

## 🔥 Now Your Second Question:

## 📂 **Linux File System Structure (Explained Simply)**

Below is the **real meaning of all important folders** you see in `/`.

This is beginner-friendly but accurate.

---

## 🔹 `/root`

* Home directory of the **root user**
* Only root has access
* Equivalent of `/home/ubuntu`
* Not the same as `/`

---

## 🔹 `/home`

* Contains home folders for normal users
  Example:

  * `/home/ubuntu`
  * `/home/user1`

Each user gets their own home folder.

---

## 🔹 `/var`

“Variable data”

Contains files that **change frequently**:

* `/var/log` → system logs
* `/var/www/html` → default web server directory
* `/var/mail` → mailbox
* `/var/run` → runtime files

---

## 🔹 `/etc`

System-wide **configuration files**.

Examples:

* `/etc/passwd`
* `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`
* `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`

Everything in **/etc** is critical.

---

## 🔹 `/bin`

Essential user-level programs:

* `ls`
* `cat`
* `cp`
* `mv`
* `mkdir`
* `rm`

Exist even in minimal systems.

---

## 🔹 `/sbin`

System binaries (need root):

* `reboot`
* `mount`
* `iptables`

---

## 🔹 `/usr`

"User system resources"
This contains **most installed software**:

* `/usr/bin` → programs
* `/usr/lib` → libraries
* `/usr/share` → docs, icons

Think of `/usr` as “Program Files” in Windows.

---

## 🔹 `/lib` and `/lib64`

System libraries required by programs:

Like `.dll` files in Windows.

---

## 🔹 `/tmp`

Temporary files.

* Anyone can write
* Often cleared after reboot

---

## 🔹 `/opt`

Optional third-party applications.

If you install tools manually, they often go here.

---

## 🔹 `/boot`

Everything needed to start Linux:

* Kernel
* Bootloader (GRUB)
* Initrd

Don’t touch unless you know what you’re doing.

---

## 🔹 `/dev`

Virtual devices:

* Hard disks → `/dev/sda`
* USB → `/dev/usb*`
* Terminal → `/dev/tty`

Linux treats devices as files.

---

## 🔹 `/proc`

Virtual directory showing **running system data**:

* CPU info → `/proc/cpuinfo`
* Memory info → `/proc/meminfo`

Used heavily by monitoring tools.

---

## 🔹 `/sys`

Like `/proc`, but for **hardware-related** information.

---

# 🧠 **Final Summary**

### ✔ Do you need root to run scripts in `/root`?

Yes. Use:

```bash
sudo /root/script.sh
```

### ✔ Why are you in `/home/ubuntu`?

Because you SSH as the `ubuntu` user.

### ✔ What is `/root`?

Root user’s home directory.
Normal users cannot access it.

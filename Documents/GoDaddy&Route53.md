# Route 53 + GoDaddy Domain Integration Guide

This document explains how DNS works, what hosted zones are, how name server records function, and how to connect a GoDaddy-purchased domain with Amazon Route 53. Everything is presented in simple steps.

---

## 1. **What Happens When You Buy a Domain?**

When you buy a domain like **mk.xyz** from GoDaddy:

* GoDaddy becomes your **domain registrar**.
* The world asks GoDaddy: “Who manages DNS for *mk.xyz*?”
* GoDaddy answers using **Name Server (NS) records**.

So GoDaddy holds the authority to say **where DNS for your domain lives**.

---

## 2. **What is DNS? (Simple Explanation)**

DNS is like a phonebook for the internet.

* You type **mk.xyz** in a browser.
* DNS converts that name into the correct **IP address**.

---

## 3. **What is a Hosted Zone in Route 53?**

A **Hosted Zone** is a container where all your DNS records live.

Route 53 hosted zones contain:

* IP mappings (A records)
* Load balancer connections (CNAME records)
* Email routing (MX records)
* Verification entries (TXT records)

When you create a hosted zone for **mk.xyz**, AWS becomes capable of managing DNS for that domain.

---

## 4. **Why Does Route 53 Ask for the Domain Name Again?**

Because Route 53 must know:

> “Which domain will this hosted zone represent?”

You enter **mk.xyz**, and Route 53 prepares DNS for that domain.

But Route 53 has no authority yet.
You still need to connect AWS to GoDaddy.

---

## 5. **Name Server (NS) Records – What They Actually Are**

NS records are the most important DNS entries.
They tell the world:

> “For this domain, who should answer DNS questions?”

Example NS records generated by Route 53:

* ns-123.awsdns-45.com
* ns-678.awsdns-90.org
* ns-222.awsdns-33.net
* ns-456.awsdns-12.co.uk

These are the addresses of Amazon’s DNS servers.

If these NS records live in GoDaddy, then AWS becomes the DNS authority.

## 6. **Linking GoDaddy to Route 53 (Important Steps)**

### Step 1: Create a Hosted Zone in Route 53

* Enter your domain name (mk.xyz).
* AWS creates the hosted zone.
* AWS gives you 4 NS records.

### Step 2: Go to GoDaddy DNS Settings

* Open your domain (mk.xyz).
* Go to **Nameservers**.
* Choose **Custom Nameservers**.
* Paste the 4 NS records from Route 53.

### Step 3: Save changes

Propagation can take **minutes to hours**.

After propagation:

* GoDaddy → sends DNS queries to → Route 53
* Route 53 → answers using your hosted zone records

## 7. **Types of DNS Records (Simple Explanation)**

Understanding each record helps you configure websites and services.

### **1. A Record (Address Record)**

Maps a domain name to an IPv4 address.

* **mk.xyz → 3.112.45.10**
* Used for: EC2 instance, server IPs.

### **2. AAAA Record**

Maps domain to IPv6 address.

### **3. CNAME (Canonical Name)**

Alias record.

* **[www.mk.xyz](http://www.mk.xyz) → mk.xyz**
* **api.mk.xyz → my-elb.amazonaws.com**

### **4. MX Record (Mail Exchange)**

Directs emails to mail servers.

* Used for Gmail, Outlook, etc.

### **5. TXT Record**

Stores text information.

* Domain verification (AWS, Google, etc.)
* SPF (email anti-spam)

### **6. NS Record**

Tells the world who is responsible for DNS.

* For root domain: must match Route 53’s NS.

### **7. SOA Record (Start of Authority)**

Technical metadata. Route 53 creates it automatically.

## 8. **Flow of a DNS Request After Setup**

Here’s what happens after your GoDaddy domain is connected to Route 53:

1. User types **mk.xyz**
2. Browser asks: “Who manages mk.xyz?”
3. GoDaddy’s registry responds with the NS records you set (Route 53 NS records)
4. Browser goes to Route 53's DNS servers
5. Route 53 looks inside your **Hosted Zone**
6. Returns the IP you configured
7. Browser loads the correct server/website

---

## 9. **Summary (Very Simple)**

* You buy a domain at GoDaddy.
* You create a hosted zone in Route 53 using the same domain.
* Route 53 gives you NS records.
* You put those NS records into GoDaddy.
* Now the entire internet will use Route 53 as your DNS.
* You create A, CNAME, MX, TXT, etc., inside Route 53 for your website/email.
